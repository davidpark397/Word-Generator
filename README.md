# word-generator

I created a word and definition generating website. Supports listening to the word and definition through the listen button, sharing the word/definition to twitter through the tweet button, and copying the text to a clipboard through the clipboard button.

I leveraged the random word (https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) and free dictionary (https://dictionaryapi.dev/) APIs.

Access the website here: https://davidpark397.github.io/word-generator/index.html
