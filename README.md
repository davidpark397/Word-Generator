# Random Word Generator

I created a word and definition generating website. The website has buttons for listening to the word/definition, sharing it to twitter, and copying the text to the clipboard.

I leveraged the random word (https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) and free dictionary (https://dictionaryapi.dev/) APIs.

Access the website here: https://davidpark397.github.io/word-generator/index.html
